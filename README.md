# LIMINA

LIMINA is building a conditional buy order checkout service. The goal is to let customers and B2B buyers commit to a purchase that only executes when predefined conditions are met – such as a specific price threshold or inventory availability. This approach helps merchants secure future sales while giving customers confidence that they’ll only pay when their terms are satisfied.

## Planned Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – front end and application framework
- **Supabase** – database and authentication
- **Shopify** – e-commerce integration
- **Stripe** – payment processing
- **Redis** – for caching and real-time messaging

## Development Setup

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended).
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Limita
   ```
3. Install dependencies (placeholder until the application is scaffolded):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server (once the Next.js app exists):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

These steps will evolve as the project transitions from static HTML prototypes to a full Next.js application.
